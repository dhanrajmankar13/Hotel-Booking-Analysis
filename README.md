# Hotel-Booking-Analysis
# Objectives
To increase hotel business some factors are important like high revenue, generation, customers satisfaction, facilities provided by hotel etc.

I am able to achieve the same things by showing to client which hotel is most preferred , percentage of repeated guests, mostly preferred food by guests, then which hotel has highest adr etc.

Most preferred room type is achieved by countplot so the client can be well prepare in advance and this insight help client for further enhancement of their hospatility.

I am able to show which food type is mostly preferred so client can offer the mostly preferred food to the guests.

Most preferred month are shown by barplot so client can be well prepared in advanced so that minimum grivances would be faced by client.

Using barplot I am able to show which hotel type has high adr so client can analyse which hotel has high income.

I am able to show which hotel is busiest hotel sp client can do relatable changes in facilities in less busy hotel type.

I am able to show the relationship between repeated guests and previous bookings not cancelled so client can preferred repeated guests.

Using barplot relationship between adr and total number of people is shown so client can preferred maximum number of people.
